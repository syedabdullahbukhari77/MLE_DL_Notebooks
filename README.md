## Project Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and experiments across a range of topics:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Supervised Learning (regression & classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Deep Learning with TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch
- Natural Language Processing using NLTK, spaCy, and Transformers
- Real-world projects (image classification, stock market prediction, NLP tasks)

These notebooks are great for self-study, bootcamp preparation, or building end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
